Writer’s Guidelines

Just like Dick, we are going to open the blog up to anyone who wants to write for it. Here are the writer’s guidelines.

You don’t have to live in the neighbourhood to join, but you need to write as if you did
Each character must fictional
Each character must be your own creation
Each character must have its own account because of the structure of the blog platform
You can have more than one character, but each must be on a separate account
The diner never closes
Keep posts below 500 words
Keep content and language PG. The diner serves children, you know.
Real world libel issues apply and are the author’s responsibility. This applies when you’re including real world businesses and personalities.
We will allow a limited number of pre-approved fictional settings to give creativity some breathing space
The editor will double as a kind of script editor or dungeon master for the sake of continuity
The editor’s say is final in all matters
The publisher will create a pay scheme (as yet to be determined)  to share in the revenue
The owner of the Dick account is the publisher and editor and therefor the boss
I own the Dick account
