In the beginning, there was the blog.

But really, the railway dining car came first. Then my dad. Then my dad grew up and bought the dining car and, at great expense and the patience of all his railroad friends, he got it to where it now sits and has sat since 1958, the year of my birth.

How he got the car there is another story. What we’re about today is to tell you what this blog is about.

This blog is about letting the community tell stories about their day. There are lots of blogs out there, but none about the Elmwood area and its people. Sure, nothing much happens in Moncton, but lives are lived everywhere. My dad worked behind the counter for  most of his life and listened to people tell him their stories. Some he shared if he knew the teller was happy to share.

I’m hoping to bring back some of that diner storytelling. So many joints are just about slapping the food on the counter and on to the next customer. It’s about the efficient assembly line. Even at Dick’s a lot of people think that’s what food service is all about and I often get looks like I’m prying when I lean on the counter to have a good listen. Or worse, they resent me because I’m keeping them from getting out of there.

People still have all those stories inside, though. They get sick, their loved ones die, they get new jobs, they get fired. I want to know what’s going on because for so many people telling someone is how they make sense of their lives. You’ve got to hear it out loud for it to become real, sometimes. Here is where you can do that.
