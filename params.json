The ‘bloggers’ are fictional but they live and breath in the real-world Elmwood area. The diner is a railroad dining car that was moved with great difficulty to its present space near Morton and Mill Rd between the Irving and Home Hardware. If the owners ever actually build something there we may have to move it, but for now, that’s where the diner is.\r\n\r\nHere’s the idea. Richard (Dick) White is the second generation owner of the diner and, wanting to get some marketing use out of the Internet, has started a blog that his patrons and employees can contribute to no matter what they want to write about. Dick’s dad, a big community-oriented guy, instilled in his son that you have to trust the people who live in your community and fully approves his son’s idea.\r\n\r\nOur journalism-based experiment is multileveled. Some questions are:\r\n\r\nCan a fictional blog about a real neighbourhood create real community in its setting?\r\nCan the blog become a community-created work of fiction, the community being the group of writers and advertisers and backers?\r\nWill local businesses want to advertise in this hyperlocal site?\r\nCan the blog provide a revenue stream for its authors?\r\nWhat kind of revenue streams can come out of this?\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
